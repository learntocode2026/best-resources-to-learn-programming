# 7 Best Resources to Learn Programming: A Developer’s Personal Guide

When I first dove into programming, the sheer volume of learning resources was overwhelming. From outdated tutorials to expensive bootcamps, I wasted months chasing material that didn’t fit my style or level. Over time, through trial, error, and mentorship, I zeroed in on resources that truly deliver practical, scalable skills.

Let me walk you through **7 best resources to learn programming**—all of which helped me move from clueless to confident engineer. Each offers something unique and actionable, whether you’re starting out or leveling up.

## 1. **Educative: Interactive, Hands-On Learning**

I remember struggling with passive video courses that didn’t click until I tried Educative. Their in-browser coding environment lets you write *and run* code as you learn—no annoying setup.

- Top courses: “Grokking the Coding Interview Pattern” and “The System Design Primer”
- Covers multiple languages, system design, and algorithms
- Bite-sized, incremental lessons with quizzes and projects

> **Why it worked for me:** I could immediately apply concepts without context-switching. The "learn by doing" approach accelerated my debugging skills and understanding of tradeoffs.

## 2. **ByteByteGo: System Design Mastery**

When prepping for senior interviews, system design seemed like a giant black box. ByteByteGo’s videos and guides broke down complex architectures into digestible components.

- Clear diagrams and in-depth explanations
- Covers real interview questions from FAANG companies
- Insights on scalability vs. maintainability tradeoffs

> **Pro tip:** Watch their "Design a URL Shortener" or "Design a Twitter Backend" videos—they helped me ace my system design rounds by practicing component interactions and bottleneck analysis.

## 3. **DesignGurus.io: Coding Interview Practice on Steroids**

Coding problems felt like memorization at first. DesignGurus.io flipped that mindset by teaching you patterns and problem-solving frameworks.

- Detailed problem walkthroughs
- Consistent pattern classification helps internalize techniques
- Community-driven insights and clarifications

> **Lesson learned:** Instead of just solving, it teaches you *how* to think like an interviewer. For example, their “Sliding Window” and “Two Pointers” sections changed how I approached array problems permanently.

## 4. **Official Language Docs: Your Ultimate Source of Truth**

I can’t overstate the value of getting comfortable with official language documentation. Many beginners avoid docs, but I’ve discovered that the best way to unlock advanced features and avoid bugs is by going straight to the source.

- For JavaScript: [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/)
- For Python: [Python.org Docs](https://docs.python.org/3/)
- For Go: [Go.dev](https://go.dev/doc/)

> **Action:** When stuck on a language feature or bug, consult the official docs first. It saves hours of fruitless Googling.

## 5. **Open Source Projects on GitHub: Real-World Code Learning**

Reading and contributing to open source was a game-changer during my early years. It forced me to understand coding conventions, version control, and collaborative workflows.

- Start by exploring beginner-friendly repos labeled “good first issue”
- Observe project structure, commit messages, and testing approaches
- Engage in code reviews to refine your coding style

> **Insight:** Open source accelerates learning beyond syntax—it introduces standards, tooling, and community communication. Plus, you build your portfolio organically.

## 6. **LeetCode: Building Problem-Solving Endurance**

Finally, those coding interview questions. LeetCode’s vast problem sets helped me build problem-solving muscle and timing under pressure.

- Problems cover array, tree, graph, DP, and many others
- Offers coding in multiple languages with instant testing
- Premium subscription unlocks mock interviews and company-specific questions

> **Advice:** Don’t just memorize solutions; try explaining your approach aloud as if mentoring someone. This improves conceptual clarity, benefiting both interviews and real projects.

## 7. **YouTube Channels: Free, Diverse Perspectives**

Video content can be a double-edged sword—some channels are excellent, others fluff. Here are a few I trust due to clarity and depth:

- **Traversy Media:** Practical web dev tutorials  
- **Tech Dummies Narendra L:** Detailed system design breakdowns  
- **The Net Ninja:** Step-by-step frontend and backend guides

> **Quick win:** Use YouTube as a supplement for topics where you prefer explanations over text, but back it up with hands-on coding.

# Bringing It All Together: How I Used These Resources

During my FAANG interview prep, I combined these tools:

- Started with Educative for basics and coding patterns  
- Used DesignGurus to deepen problem-solving techniques  
- Leveraged ByteByteGo for system design frameworks  
- Practiced timed tests on LeetCode  
- Consulted official docs anytime a language question arose  
- Contributed to open source to apply knowledge and get feedback  

This mix built a sturdy foundation—both conceptually and psychologically. It’s easy to get overwhelmed, but **structured repetition and diversification** work wonders.

# Final Thoughts: Your Learning Roadmap

- Pick one or two resources that click with your style—don’t scatter focus.  
- Practice consistently; even 30 minutes daily beats cramming.  
- Engage with communities—Reddit r/learnprogramming, GitHub discussions—to clarify doubts.  
- Embrace failure and reflect: debugging is learning in disguise.  
- Iterate on your learning plan every few months to adapt new tools and languages.

You’re closer than you think to becoming the programmer you want to be. Each resource here represents a hard-earned lesson from my journey. I hope sharing them saves you time and frustration.
